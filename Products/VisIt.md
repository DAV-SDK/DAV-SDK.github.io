## VisIt

### Description

VisIt is a free, open source, platform-independent, distributed, parallel visualization tool for visualizing data defined on two- and three-dimensional structured and unstructured meshes. VisItâ€™s distributed architecture allows it to leverage both the compute power of a large parallel computer and the graphics acceleration hardware of a local workstation. VisItâ€™s user interface is often run locally on a Windows, Linux, or macOS desktop computer while its compute engine component runs in parallel on a remote computer. VisItâ€™s distributed architecture allows VisIt to visualize simulation data where it was generated, eliminating the need to move the data to a visualization server. VisIt can be controlled by its Graphical User Interface (GUI), through the Python and Java programming languages, or from a custom user interface you develop yourself. More information about VisIt can be found online at https://visit.llnl.gov/.

VisIt is a scalable production visualization and analysis tool widely used throughout DOE. It is designed to support visualization at scale.
