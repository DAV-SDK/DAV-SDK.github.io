## ADIOS

### Description

ADIOS, the Adaptable Input/Output (I/O) System, transports data as groups of self-describing variables and attributes across different media types (such as files, wide-area networks, and remote direct memory access) using a common application programming interface for all transport modes. ADIOS focuses on I/O scalable performance, adaptability, and ease of use.

      <td>
        ADIOS is a scalable I/O solution that provides high I/O performance for applications from a single computer to exascale supercomputers. It is deployed at all major DOE compute facilities and used by high-profile applications in their daily production runs, including a number of DOE applications, such as WarpX, ImpactX, XGC, GENE, GEM, E3SM, S3D, Bout++, and GTC, and other data-intensive applications, like SPECFEM3D_GLOBE, PIConGPU, GE Researchâ€™ CFD simulation, TAE fusion simulations, etc.

        **Sustainability**
      </td>
      <td>
        ADIOS's fundamental capabilities are file-based storage I/O and various in situ data transfers, namely in memory, in the system, and in wide-area-network staging. The continued support of these capabilities in updated or new systems and evolving or new applications is highly dependent on DOE funding.
